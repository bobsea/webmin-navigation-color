Don't like the new default brown color on the webmin page?
After much searching on the internet I finally found a way to change it with a simple edit of a confg file.

I have tried it and it works for me but I am not a programer so I don't know if it will break the system at some point.

So here is how I changed the color from 'brown' to 'blue' the old default color.

In the terminal go to /etc/webmin/authentic-theme
Look for the settings file named settings-'your username'
Open the file using sudo nano settings-username (use your text editor)

Look for the line - settings_navigation_color='xxxxxx'; where xxxxxx is the current navigation color.
Change the color to what you want ie 'red' 'blue' 'green'

Save the file and navigate to the webmin page, if you already have the page open refresh it to see the change.

That is it! Hope that helps you.

Bob
